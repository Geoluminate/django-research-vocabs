<!-- ## About -->
<!-- 
`django-research-vocabs` is a Django app that provides a set of tools for incorporating established research vocabularies into your Django projects. -->

Research vocabularies refer to specific sets of terms and terminology that are used within a particular field of study or discipline. These vocabularies are designed to provide a standardized and consistent way of expressing concepts, ideas, and relationships within that field. They play a crucial role in facilitating effective communication and understanding among researchers, scholars, and professionals.

One of the more common formats for publishing research vocabularies is the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/). SKOS is a W3C recommendation that provides a model for expressing controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, and other types of knowledge organization systems. It is widely used in the context of the Semantic Web and Linked Data initiatives.

`django-research-vocabs` aims to parse RDF files that adhere to the SKOS format and convert them into a format that is usable within Django.


<!-- 
Research vocabularies are becoming increasingly common for several reasons:

1. **Standardization and Consistency:** By using standardized vocabularies, researchers can ensure that terms are consistently defined and used across different studies and publications. This helps to eliminate ambiguity and improves the clarity of communication within a specific field.

2. **Interoperability:** Standardized research vocabularies contribute to interoperability, allowing different systems, databases, and tools to exchange and integrate information seamlessly. This is particularly important in interdisciplinary research where data from multiple sources may need to be combined and analyzed.

3. **Data Integration and Sharing:** With the growing emphasis on open science and data sharing, research vocabularies become essential for integrating diverse datasets. Using a common vocabulary makes it easier for researchers to share, compare, and combine data, leading to more robust and comprehensive analyses.

4. **Facilitating Literature Searches:** Standardized vocabularies are employed in databases and search engines to index and retrieve relevant literature. This makes it easier for researchers to discover related studies and build upon existing knowledge within their field.

5. **Enhancing Reproducibility:** Clear and standardized terminology contributes to the reproducibility of research findings. When researchers use the same vocabulary to describe their methods and results, it becomes easier for others to replicate experiments and validate results.

6. **Semantic Web and Linked Data:** Research vocabularies are crucial in the context of the Semantic Web and Linked Data initiatives, where information is linked in a way that is understandable not only to humans but also to machines. This facilitates the development of advanced data-driven applications and services.

7. **Efficient Communication:** Researchers from different geographic locations, cultural backgrounds, and disciplinary perspectives can benefit from a shared vocabulary. This helps in fostering efficient communication and collaboration, as everyone involved can understand and use the same terminology.

In summary, research vocabularies are essential tools for creating a common language within a field of study. They contribute to standardization, interoperability, and efficient communication, ultimately advancing the progress of research and knowledge dissemination. -->
